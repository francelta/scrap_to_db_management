# scrap_to_db_management


Web Scraping and Database Management Script:

  This Python script automates the process of scraping web content, managing product information, and performing operations such as text paraphrasing and translation. It leverages several powerful libraries including sqlite3, easyocr, OpenCV (cv2), pytesseract, woocommerce, selenium, BeautifulSoup, and googletrans, among others, to extract data from web pages, manipulate images, translate text, and interact with a WooCommerce API.

Features:

  Web Scraping: Utilizes selenium and BeautifulSoup for scraping product details from web pages.
  OCR Functionality: Implements easyocr and pytesseract for Optical Character Recognition to extract text from images.
  Database Operations: Uses sqlite3 for storing and managing scraped data in a local database.
  WooCommerce Integration: Connects to WooCommerce via its API for managing product information on a web store.
  Translation and Text Paraphrasing: Leverages googletrans and custom functions for translating and paraphrasing text to enhance product descriptions.
  Image Processing: Applies OpenCV for image capture and manipulation tasks.
  
Prerequisites:

  Ensure you have Python 3.x installed along with the following libraries:

    pip install opencv-python easyocr pytesseract woocommerce googletrans pymysql selenium beautifulsoup4
    
  Note: Additional setup for selenium (e.g., Chrome WebDriver) and pytesseract (e.g., Tesseract-OCR installation) may be required.

Setup:

  Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
  Install all required Python libraries mentioned in the Prerequisites section.
  Ensure you have the necessary credentials and access tokens for WooCommerce and any other services used by the script.
  
Usage:
